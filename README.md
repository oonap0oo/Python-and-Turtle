This script shows a series of patterns of Truchet Tiles.

The tiles are drawn using the Turtle libary. All patters are made from 4 different tiles.

The patterns are defined as rows and columns of tile numbers, for this nested tuples are used:

    pattern_X = (
        (2,4,3,4,4,2),
        (2,1,2,2,4,4),
        (3,4,4,2,2,4),
        (2,2,4,4,2,1),
        (4,2,2,4,3,4),
        (4,4,2,1,2,2)
        )
